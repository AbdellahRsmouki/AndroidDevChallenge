## Tell us what your idea is. 
________________________________________

The main idea is to help the user memories important information while he is watching YouTube videos or other videos using google “notes keep”.
 Normally, the video maker needs to specify as example the main sources used in the video description, and then the user can reach them easily.  
Our idea is more than that; we need to give the user a complete source of data that will help him to remember the context he was in whenever he wants.
Let’s put us in the main situation, The user heard an important information, so instead of going back to apps and choose “notes keep”, a simple notification icon will pop up and give him the possibility to write a note. After that, the note will be saved with additional data like date and time and video name and others.

To resume, the idea is an application of a machine learning algorithm to detect note related contexts in a video using “google translate” application and then proceeding the process of showing the “notes keep” application.


## Tell us how you plan on bringing it to life. 
________________________________________

At first, the idea is no more than an ML algorithm combined with tree Google products. The knowledge and the experience gathered from the process of including google translate in YouTube will be more than enough to bring our idea to life.
Essentially, the first step is to create an android application that reads texts using “google translate” so that we can implement the machine-learning algorithm correctly. This application is mandatory in our process because we will test the desired functionalities.
After that, we’ll have to add the “notes keep” application when the user clicks on the pop up. This process is no more than adding features and developing the necessary functionalities.
The last step is to include this process in applications like YouTube.

Hello! I am Abdellah Rsmouki, Third year Software engineering student at the National School of Computer Science and Systems Analysis (Morocco), full-stack Developer, and passionate about mobile development and UX/UI Design.

One of the projects I feel proud to be a part of is the model I developed for e-mobadara association. We had put a lot of effort developing our ideas and turning them into reality. 

I also had worked with a company as an intern and we had developed a very interesting application using Android and various technologies. We had been learning almost everything we faced while we were developing the project.
In addition, I had some experience in UI/UX design from freelancing because design is one of the principal steps developing any project.

Now I feel more comfortable with the Android environment and I start digging into some Machine Learning algorithms and projects.

The main purpose of me doing this project is that I love coding and working on new ideas. Machine Learning can be implemented in many use cases and the idea mentioned above is one of them. Therefore, I will appreciate any help that can turn this idea into reality and optimize a very long process of saving remarks.
